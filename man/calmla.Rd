}
\arguments{
\item{img}{RasterStack or RasterBrick.}

\item{endm}{Signatures. Geometry type, Points or Polygons (typically shapefile),
containing the training data.}

\item{model}{Model to use. It can be Support Vector Machine (\link[e1071]{svm}) like
\code{model = 'svm'}, Random Forest (\link[randomForest]{randomForest})
like \code{model = 'randomForest'}, Naive Bayes (\link[e1071]{naiveBayes})
like \code{model = 'naiveBayes'}, Decision Tree (\link[caret]{train})
like \code{model = 'LMT'}, Neural Networks (\link[nnet]{nnet})
like \code{model = 'nnet'}, K-nearest Neighbors (\link[caret]{knn3}) like \code{model = 'knn'}.}

\item{training_split}{For splitting samples into two subsets, i.e. training data and
for testing data.}

\item{approach}{Calibration method. There are for options: Simple training and testing
(Set-Approach) like \code{approach == 'Set-Approach'}, Leave One Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) like
\code{approach == 'LOOCV'}, Cross-Validation (K-fold) like \code{approach == 'k-fold'} and
Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (MCCV) like \code{approach == 'MCCV'}.}

\item{k}{Number of groups for splitting samples. It must be used only with the
Cross-Validation (K-fold) approach. Default is \code{k = 10}.}

\item{iter}{Number of iterations, i.e number of times the analysis is executed.}

\item{verbose}{This parameter is Logical. It Prints progress messages during execution.}

\item{...}{Parameters to be passed to a machine learning algorithm. Please see \link[e1071]{svm}, \link[randomForest]{randomForest}, \link[e1071]{naiveBayes}, \link[caret]{train}, \link[nnet]{nnet} and \link[caret]{knn3}}

\description{
This function allows to calibrate supervised classification in satellite images
through various algorithms and using approaches such as Set-Approach,
Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), Cross-Validation (k-fold) and
Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (MCCV).
}
\details{
If the "Set-Approach" method is being used, it is not necessary to use parameter \code{k}.
\code{k} only can be used when the Cross-Validation (k-fold) method is used. On the other hand,
to create groups in Cross-Validation, the \code{createFolds} function of "caret" is used.
See \link[caret]{createFolds} for more details.
}
\note{
At the moment, only one calibration approach can be used.
